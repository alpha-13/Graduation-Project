# Introduction
Hello Friends, <br/>
I'm Mohamed Elsayed computer science student at mansoura university, Egypt <br/>
This is my graduation project for home automation and smart car, It's simple because there is no more time or support to make it better than this and I'm developing it as a beginner student so if you see that project is not better than you think forgive me and I'll try to make it better in the future if I've enough time.<br/>
Although I'm beginner, I take this as an opportunity from the beginning to share this project with you so that you can see What the project can do?, What are the main components? and How you can modify it to make it better and help others? (it's called Win-Win strategy), so now feel as if it's your project :smiley:

# How to use
To use this project you must check the documentation Chapter 2 to know how the system work? and see all sensors and actuators required for this system, after that please check "Source Code" directory and install the android application on your phone using android studio or eclipse from (Android directory), and the remaining directories (Car Driver) and (Home Automation) take a copy from them to your raspberry pi, (Car Driver) directory contains "eyeBlink" module which detect eye if it is closed or not! in (Home Automation) directory there is a folder called Arduino please upload "Sensors" skitch to your arduino after connecting it with raspberry pi using serial cable, again in (Home Automation) directory you have five main modules to run from terminal: -
1. FaceRec: Used when we need to recognize any face for door opening.
2. IServer: Receiving any instruction from user.
3. Location: Check if the car is near or far if user's phone into the car!
4. Trainer: used to add new user into the system.
5. Transfer Images: Transfer any unauthorized user image to users.

For more information please read the documentation and comments into all modules.

# What's next
If you want to make this system better please check chapter 7 in the documentation which contains 4 levels: -
1. Level 1 (Rise): Update current system functions to make it more powerful and effective.
2. Level 2 (Professional): Add new functions to our system.
3. Level 3 (Secure): Add new functions to secure your home and car.
4. Level 4 (Intelligent): Use AI approches like machine learning to make our system more intelligent and attractive.
